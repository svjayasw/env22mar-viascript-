To Install the CP210x Drivers:

Please review RELEASE-NOTES prior to installing for any known installation issues.

**Do Not Log In as ROOT**

Unzip cp210x-3.1.0 in your home directory.

**Please note that in 2.4, the path to usb-serial.h is hard coded in the file ./cp210x/cp210x.h

**Please note that in 2.4, the path to KERNELDIR is hard coded in the file ./cp210x/rules.mak

To make install and source rpm packages, from a terminal prompt:

run ./makerpm

To install, run the rpm installation package which by default will be at:

cd /var/temp/silabs/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386

Follow onscreen instructions.


Known Issues and Limitations
----------------------------

2.6 Kernel
	- Built to support up to 2.6.29/30 (the last release of 2.6 at the time of
	development).
	- makerpm - only supports builds for the running kernel.
	- .spec - dependencies are broken.

2.4 Kernel
	- Built to support only 2.4.36 (the last release of 2.4 at the time of
	development).
	- makerpm - may require a root password if the following files are not in the
	/usr/lib/rpm directory:
		brp-java-repack-jars
		brp-python-bytecompile
		check-rpaths
		check-rpaths-worker
	- .spec - dependencies are broken.
	- makerpm - only supports builds for the kernel linked to by /usr/src/linux-2.4
	is hard coded too. KERNELDIR is defined in Rules.make on line 17:
		KERNELDIR = /home/user/linux-2.x.y
	- cp210x.h - path to usb-serial.h is hardcoded.
