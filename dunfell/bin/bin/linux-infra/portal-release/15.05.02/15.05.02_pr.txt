commit 034e7cbef5db4a259e9658939e16c53909fc1f34
Author: Dinh Nguyen <dinguyen@opensource.altera.com>
Date:   Thu Apr 23 15:41:51 2015 -0500

    FogBugz #294479: Add the l4_sys_free_clk clock node
    
    The l4_sys_free_clk is noc_free_clk that goes through a fixed divider of 4
    and cannot get gated. The l4_sys_free_clk is also the correct clock for
    timers 2 and 3.

commit 43f9529d05f3b59f48f49f36d7d40044da7ff353
Author: Andreas Oetken <andreas@oetken.name>

    altera tse: Fix network-delays and -retransmissions after high throughput.
    
    Fix bug which occurs when more than <limit> packets are available during
    napi-poll, leading to "delays" and retransmissions on the network.
    
    Check for (count < limit) before checking the get_rx_status in tse_rx-function.
    Function get_rx_status is reading from the response-fifo.
    If there is currently a response in the fifo,
    reading the last byte of the response pops the value from the fifo.
    If the limit is checked as second condition
    and the limit is reached the fifo is popped but the packet is not processed.

    FogBugz #291165:TSE-MSGMDA linux driver is not working for Max10
    
    This patch resolves false CRC errors from mSGDMA in TX mSGDMA MM to ST
    mode. Hence the error IRQ needs to be masked off, otherwise mSGDMA will
    indicate data as errors to TSE block. Previous mSGDMA had hardware bug that
    masked off this errors as default.

    ARM: socfpga: dts: Add tx-fifo-depth and rx-fifo-depth properties
    
    Add tx-fifo-depth and rx-fifo-depth devicetree properties for socfpga
    stmmac. These devicetree properties will be used to configure certain
    features of the stmmac on the socfpga.

    stmmac: Configure Flow Control to work correctly based on rxfifo size
    
    Configure flow control correctly, and based on the receive fifo size read
    as a property from the devicetree since the Synopsys stmmac fifo sizes are
    configurable based on a particular chip's implementation. This patch maintains
    the previous incorrect behavior unless the receive fifo size is found in the
    devicetree.
