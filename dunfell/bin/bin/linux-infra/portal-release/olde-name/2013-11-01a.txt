    FogBugz #163802: arch/nios2: Copy FDT from init memory to regular memory
    
    If the supplied DTB is builtin into kernel, it is in __init memory and
    will eventually be destroyed after bootup. But if drivers are loaded as
    modules, they still need to access the DTB entries after the kernel has
    started. Therefore, the DTB is moved to a new allocated area.
    Thanks Jeroen Van den Keybus for the fix.

    FogBugz #163905: Support Denali NAND driver on socfpga platform
    
    This patch addresses a few bugs and features in the Denali NAND driver on the socfpga platform.
    
    First the bugs:
    
    - Reading ONFI parameters would cause a timeout, because the code sent the wrong
    commands to the controller/device.  That was fixed, and in the process, code was
    added to wait for the appropriate interrupt.
    
    - When using the JFFS2 file system, a bug was discovered in the write OOB
    data function, whereby the controller was left in SPARE mode causing
    subsequent page reads to fail.  The write OOB function was modified
    so that the controller is left in MAIN access mode.
    
    Now the features:
    
    - The Denali NAND controller in the socfpga platform has hardware ECC, and several
    status bits are different because of that.  A patch from Jamie Iles <jamie at jamieiles.com>
    was used as the basis for supporting hardware ECC in the code.
    
    - The device tree and documentation were modified to support hardware ECC.
    
    - One of our test socfpga boards had a NAND chip which was locked by default.  To support
    writing to the chip, the UNLOCK1 and UNLOCK2 commands were implemented.  The nand_unlock
    calls were added as well.  (Note, the mtd layer has _lock, _unlock, and is probably a
    better place to implement this functionality than the nand driver).
    
    - The mtd_device_register call was replaced with mtd_device_parse_register so that
    device tree partitions are setup by the mtd layer.  Example partitions were added
    to the device tree.
    
    - In the process of supporting our specific controller configuration, duplicate
    definitions of bad block table descriptions were removed from the denali code.  They
    also exist in the nand driver code.

    FogBugz #119760: Document Designware SPI driver bindings
    
    The community Memory Mapped Designware SPI driver is not
    currently documented so it is added here.
    
    V2:
      Use generic interrupt description instead of GIC specific.
    
    V3:
      Cleanup of extra lines & compatible description.
    
    V4:
      Addition of clock source.

    FogBugz #163712: Add SDRAM ECC/EDAC support to Altera CycloneV board
    
    Firmware to support the EDAC framework for the SDRAM ECC on the
    Altera CycloneV board is added in this patch.
    - The SDRAM Controller registers are used by the FPGA bridge so
      these are accessed through the syscon interface.
    - The interrupts are included in the sdramedac device tree node
      and accessed with the platform functions.
    - The configuration of the SDRAM memory size for the EDAC framework
      is discovered from the memory node of the device tree.
    - Documentation of the bindings in devicetree/bindings/arm/altera
    
    V2: Implement review changes.
    - Fix copyright.
    - Call edac_mc_free() if error on devres_open_group().
    - Remove pr_debugs.
    - Fix spacing in calculation for readability.
    - Add platform_set_drvdata() in alt_sdram_mc_remove().
    - Add of_match_ptr() around .of_match_table element.
    
    V3:
    - Replace pr_debug() with dev_dbg().
    - Remove /r line endings.
    
    V4:
    - Check return code of regmap_read() in probe.
    
    V5:
    - Clear regmap_read() variables before use.
    - Check return code when looking for memory size.
    - Include attribution in copyright.
    - Enable IRQ after successfully adding memory controller.
    
    V6:
    - Rename functions and macros from ALT to ALTR
    - Cleanup of code to reflect Linux conventions.
    - Replace MODULE_ALIAS with MODULE_AUTHOR("Altera Corporation");

    FogBugz #133693: Fixes for Jumbo frame crash caused by improper sizing of receive buffers
    
    The root causes for the Jumbo frame problems seen were:
    
    1) The driver was enabling Jumbo frames up to 9018 bytes in length (MTU = 9000)
       without allocating the correct amount of receive buffer space. When the
       controller received a packet larger than the smaller receive buffer,
       the controller's DMA overwrote kernel memory, causing code/data
       corruption eventually leading to a kernel crash.
    
    2) The driver was not setting the correct DMA mapping length before
       mapping receive buffers. This led to a subsequent unmapping operation
       using an incorrect mapping length with respect to the one used for
       mapping. As long as the user did not bring down then up the driver, there
       was no problem. This problem only showed up as a result of testing
       MTU changes by cycling the interface up and down through different MTUs.
    
    The fixes implemented for these problems were:
    
    1) Add configuration parameter in the device tree for maximum Jumbo
       frame size. This is needed since the transmit and receive fifos
       sizes are configurable when the cores are created through Synopsys
       Core Consultant. Having this parameter allows DMA I/O memory to
       be conserved as much as possible by only allocating what's required
       for packet receives.
    
       Example: If the MTU was set to 9000 and the transmit and receive
       fifos were set to 4096 bytes, then a receive buffer size of 16K
       would be used when only 4096 is required.
    
       The valid range for the C5 SOC is 2000 through 4062, inclusive.
    
    2) Update Documentation text file for stmmac parameters by adding
       "snps,max-mtu" See 1) above for details.
    
    3) Changes to handle proper range checking of MTU in stmmac_change_mtu
    
    4) Use correct DMA buffer length when allocating receive buffers
    
    5) Default Configuration Register 0 settings were changed to
       not enable Jumbo frame by default. 802.3as frame size expansion
       is enabled by default, and Jumbo frame is enabled only if MTU
       size is set for Jumbo frames. This permits receive buffer
       size allocation per current MTU settings.
    
    6) DMA buffer sizes are properly sized for the maximum MTU size configured.
