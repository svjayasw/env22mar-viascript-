    FogBugz #173185: OCRAM ECC addition for Altera SOCFPGA.
    
    Add On-Chip RAM ECC to the Error Detection And Correction module for
    tracking ECC errors in Altera's SOCFPGA OCRAM.
    This patch adds code to the kernel startup that initializes OCRAM
    and ensures the ECC is enabled. The generic EDAC Manager driver
    handles the addition of OCRAM to the driver when the OCRAM "compatible"
    field in the device tree matches.
    Specific data is loaded depending upon which type of ECC (L2 or OCRAM)
    is being initalized.
    
    V2 Changes:
    - Fix error message in OCRAM initialization.
    - Document the device tree bindings for OCRAM & OCRAM ECC.
    - Change variable name from sram to iram for clarity.
    - Resync with main since EDAC L2 trigger was added.
    
    V3 Changes:
    - Remove OCRAM device tree binding file.
    - Add conditional compile statements for L2 clear in socfpga.c
    
    V4 Changes:
    - Add OCRAM only config.
    - Split OCRAM initialization into own files (ocram.c & ocram.h)
    - Conditionally compile OCRAM matching tag.
    
    V5 Changes:
    - Cleanup of ocramedac address in socfpga.dtsi
    - Use pr_err() consistently in ocram.c
    
    V6 Changes:
    - Cleanup of ocramedac address in socfpga-ocram-ecc.txt.
    - Remove unused .setup function pointer.

    FogBugz #178128: Conditionally enable L2 EDAC.
    
    Currently the L2 cache is the only ECC module implemented in
    the ECC Manager. However, as more modules are added, the need
    to turn each module on & off is required. The addition of
    conditional compiles based on a new CONFIG (L2 ECC) is added
    here.
    
    V2:
    Include dependency on CONFIG_CACHE_L2X0

    FogBugz #172665: Sample driver for DMA transfer to FPGA soft IP (FIFO)
    
    -This fpga-dma driver is an example driver for a specific FPGA soft IP
    -The soft IP presents a FIFO which can be read and written through
    the debugfs interface
    -The DMA transfer code uses 'generic' dma interfaces
    -The fpga-dma driver uses generic register and DMA definitions
    in the devicetree
    
    V2:
    -Device tree changes removed from socfpga_cyclone5.dts and
    documented in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/altera/fpga-dma.txt
    
    V3:
    -Formatting changes, used Lindent script to format fpga-dma.c
    
    V4:
    -More formatting changes, lined up #defines, alphabetize headers

    FogBugz #176300: Add support for multiple clock parents
    
    The periph and sdram PLL can have any of 3 parents. For the perip pll, the
    parents can be either: osc1, osc2, or f2s_periph_ref_clk. For the sdram pll,
    the parents can be: osc1, osc2, or f2s_sdram_ref_clk.
    
    Update the clock driver to read the appropriate register for determine the
    correct parent for the periph and sdram PLL.
    
    Add the new clock entries into the socfpga DTSI file. Also remove the
    "clock-frequency" property for the f2s_periph_ref_clk from the DTSI file, as
    this property should be in the DTS file.

    Currently, user can get the EMAC address through the U-Boot
    environment that stored within flash devices.

    FogBugz #158674: Enhance drivers to use derived clock value
    
    Enhance the drivers for flash controllers (SDMMC and QSPI)
    and UART to determine the incoming clock frequency (from PLL)
    based on derived values instead of macros.
    
    The derived values are based on Clock Manager registers and incoming
    clock source frequencies (from handoff file pll_config.h). This
    enhancement will avoid user manually update the clock frequencies
    for drivers when any changes made to Clock Manager configuration.
