Subject: SoCEDS 15.1.1 code complete 5pm Friday 13th SJ time

 

Hi All,

Just to remind you all that SoCEDS 15.1.1 will be code complete and branch of
current main line at 5pm Friday 13th SJ time. Please ensure that all your
deliverables are checked in before then. Standard put approval flow applies
after CC. I will be announcing the RC builds based on stability of the initial
builds, then after that we should have weekly RCs on Wednesdays to match the
ACDS 15.1.1 dependencies.

 

Thanks.

 

 

--Gooi
