Hi Sen,

Yes it is agreed. Like I have mentioned we have our own weekly tests to ensure it. All is fine 
with his plan

Just to ensure we are all on the same page.

Alan is OK to do the bi-weekly release. However, he does not responsible for the quality of your repos. I 
wanted to ensure there is a light weight process on this… will all of you agree on the point Alan 
mentioned below?

  Thanks

Sen

Hi Alan

We do have weekly regressions running along with the ACDS tests. Therefore the entire LTSI 
kernel would be tested bi weekly in case of any changes

I have no issues with your plans as it seems to be part of what is working for us now. As long as 
the commits are updated monthly I do not see an issue.

[ATULL] I’m a little confused by this statement.  The updates are biweekly, so I don’t 
understand what you mean by ‘updated monthly’

Subject: RE: Pushing meta-altera-refdes into bi-weekly release

Hi Hean Loong and Ying Cheh,

This means we’re adding 4 repos recently and I think it’s good if we clarify the process and the 
ownership of testing.   Part of the goal here is: since the release happens every other week, we need to 
keep the process light so it can keep flowing without normally requiring extra time.  Here’s the process, I 
repeated some of the stuff that is probably already known to you just for clarity.

Each biweekly release day:
*	I will tag the head of the specified repo branches as rc1 in internal git (at-git) and send out a 
portal report email for the rc1.
*	Two weeks later, I retag the rc1 tags as ‘pr’ and push them out to github, and send out a portal 
report email for the pr.
*	So actually each biweekly release day I’ll do a pr from the previous rc1 (i.e. 19.04.02_pr ) and 
then I’ll tag the new rc1 that becomes a pr in two weeks (i.e. 19.05.01_rc1)
*	That leaves less than 2 weeks for testing rc1 before pr.  Testing rc1 for the repos that we are 
adding will continue be owned by PNG.  If there are any issues, the testers will need to reply to 
the portal report email and let me know before the release day.  Then we’ll have to decide what 
is the best thing to do in this case.  Possible options would be:
o	If a fix has been pushed, I can retag as rc2 and proceed with the pr from that.  
o	If no fix exists yet, I can retag rc2 from the previous tag and then proceed with the pr.
*	Breakages that require me to retag as rc2 before doing the pr should be very rare so that the 
process doesn’t start to take extra time normally.
*	Also normally, I won’t be delaying the release to wait for a fix.  This shouldn’t be a problem since 
there’s always another release coming in 2 weeks that can have the fix.

Do you see any issues with  this process and plan for ownership?

Also, is there anybody else that should be added for the portal report email now?

Thanks,
Alan

Hi Hean Loong,

That will be fine with me.  Next update is May 2.  We can start then if that is ok with you all.

That means that all these repos that are being added will be tagged with the biweekly style tags such as
rel_socvp_socfpga_udk2015_19.04.02_pr (this was a uefi-socfpga tag from last week’s update.  I just 
want to make it clear that whatever we are pushing out biweekly gets the ‘rel_’ tags also.

Alan

Subject: Pushing meta-altera-refdes into bi-weekly release

Hi Alan,

Would it be possible to push the meta-altera-refdes and linux-refdesigns into github biweekly 
(following the linux-soicfpga cadence) so that in the future we have a constant update on the 
github for reference design codes ?

As well as if there are problem we could just point to next releases

Let me know your thoughts
