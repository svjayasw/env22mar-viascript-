Alan,

Need your help with GSRD tag push, table as below

 

Chin Liang, Graham, Ying Cheh, Yves,

I’ve checked the commit id of each component, but do raise concern if the commit
in respective component/repository is not ready for release.

 

Ying Cheh,

Need your approval on the release

 

Note: u-boot for CV/AV’s commit ID is one commit ahead of SoCEDS’s preloader.

All,

 

Let’s wait for the socfpga_refdes nightly build/test tonight to pass (with
Graham’s squash changes), then I do a retag the RC1 tags then only we go for the
pushes.

 

A quick note: The repo have dtbt commits included, which is still under PDT
approval process, are there concerns on pushing it up to github.com?

 

Thanks

Tien Hock

Hi Tien Hock,

 

I haven’t pushed out the tags yet, waiting on meta-altera.  I am unclear about
whether more commits need to be added to the uboot/linux commit ids that Graham
mentioned.  Please retag meta-altera, get the approvals, and I’ll do the push.

 

Thanks,

Alan

I’ve squashed and pushed the commits to at-git:meta-altera.  I saved the old
angstrom-v2015.12-yocto2.0 branch to angstrom-v2015.12-yocto2.0-saved-by-graham.

 

The code is the same with the exception that the uboot 2016.03 recipe is in the
branch.

 

Please note that this process involved deleting the old
angstrom-v2015.12-yocto2.0, and recreating it with the squashed version.  If you
have any local copies of the branch, they will be out of sync.  You should
delete/rename your local copies and recheckout the angstrom-v2015.12-yocto2.0
branch.

 

I did not change any uboot or 4.1.22 commit ids, those would be separate
patches.

 

-Graham

The meta-altera commits need to be squashed before they can be pushed to
github.   I am sorry if that was not clear.

Alan,

Need your help with GSRD tag push, table as below

 

Chin Liang, Graham, Ying Cheh, Yves,

I’ve checked the commit id of each component, but extra pairs of eyes wouldn’t
hurt J.

A quick note on the meta-altera side, Graham hasn’t pushed the squashed commits
up at at-git yet, so the current commit id is with the changes that Graham
previously committed. If anyone has concerns over this please raise it.
Otherwise, we’ll need approval from Ying Cheh for the pushes.

 

Note: u-boot for CV/AV’s commit ID is one commit ahead of SoCEDS’s preloader.

Hi Alan,

 

A quick heads up, we’re closing to RC builds, and will need to be pushing tags
up from at-git to github.com/altera-opensource.

I’ll ping you once we have the tags ready to be pushed.

 

Let me know if there’re concerns on this.

 

Thanks

Tien Hock
