Alan,

Need your help with GSRD tag push, table as below


Chin Liang, Graham, Ying Cheh, Yves,

I’ve checked the commit id of each component, but extra pairs of eyes wouldn’t
hurt J.

A quick note on the meta-altera side, Graham hasn’t pushed the squashed commits
up at at-git yet, so the current commit id is with the changes that Graham
previously committed. If anyone has concerns over this please raise it.
Otherwise, we’ll need approval from Ying Cheh for the pushes.

Note: u-boot for CV/AV’s commit ID is one commit ahead of SoCEDS’s preloader.

Hi Alan,

 

A quick heads up, we’re closing to RC builds, and will need to be pushing tags
up from at-git to github.com/altera-opensource.

I’ll ping you once we have the tags ready to be pushed.

 

Let me know if there’re concerns on this.

 

Thanks

Tien Hock
