Hi Alan,

The background is that we tag stuff built by Angstrom.
In A10, U-Boot is built part of SOCEDS and that why its not tagged.

But that might create confusion since customer cannot find correspoding A10 U-Boot tag in github.
Thanks and have a nice day!

Subject: Push Arria10 u-boot ACDS18.1_REL_A10_GSRD_PR into github

Hi Alan,

Recently we were requested to push A10 u-boot tags into github that correspond with the ACDS version release

Below are the tags and commit that Tien Fong and Chin Liang requested:

uboot-socfpga socfpga_v2014.10_arria10_bringup	 2a2102e92e470beec51d8b2dea8323cfc92f92b1	ACDS18.0_REL_A10_GSRD_PR	    libfdt: Initialize the stack variable

    Report Coverity log:
        The code uses a variable that has not
	    been initialized, leading to unpredictable
	        or unintended results.

uboot-socfpga socfpga_v2014.10_arria10_bringup	3d79f8aaf8930da2c118a52ef831739e6d855295	ACDS18.1_REL_A10_GSRD_PR	    FogBugz #582382: Fix integer overflow for Arria 10

    dramaddrw data structure are defined as u32. Compiler assume 32-bit
        arithmetic on expression and the shifting operation to be done on a
	    32-bit value. So, the expression would overflow if the shifting
	        is more than 32-bit.
