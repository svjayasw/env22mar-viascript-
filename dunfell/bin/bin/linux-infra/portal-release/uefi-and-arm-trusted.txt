Alan,

Yup, every other week, same as uboot-socfpga and linux-socfpga. For now, it should be the master 
branch, and socfpga_v1.4. 

Thanks

Hi Tien Hock,

Yes, no problem.  So these will be updated to github every other week like uboot-socfpga and linux-
socfpga.  Which branches will be currently releasing?

Alan

Alan,

Can you help setup a bi-weekly sync between github and at-git for arm-trusted-firmware and uefi-
socfpga, like in uboot-socfpga and linux-socfpga?

Thanks
Tien Hock
