Subject: oob patch


I have removed the following tag and commit from our github repo.  Appologies
if this breaks your build.

The code contained in this commit looks OK and is about to be accepted
upstream (that's where it came from) but it was missing the author's
signoff line.  So it's being removed essentially for licensing reasons
rather than code issues.  Documentation pointing to the external patch
will be added to our portal for the benefit of customers needing this
functionality.

This commit was at the top of the github branch, so I was able
to just move the branch head back one commit.

I rebased to remove it from our at-git git branch.

    FogBugz #381598: Add large OOB patch to mtd-utils to support new NAND 
chips.
    
    This patch adds a bbappend file to the meta-altera layer so that
    the mtd-utils will support large OOB sizes on the newer NAND chips.
    The patch was obtained from online mailing lists, and is not
    part of the upstream mtd-utils.
