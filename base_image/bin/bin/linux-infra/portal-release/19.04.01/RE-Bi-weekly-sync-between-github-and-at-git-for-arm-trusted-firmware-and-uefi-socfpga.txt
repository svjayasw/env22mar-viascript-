Subject: RE: Bi-weekly sync between github and at-git for arm-trusted-firmware and uefi-socfpga

Hi Tien Hock,

Can you explain to me what is going on with the uefi-socfpga master branch?
[TH] I wasn’t aware that Sau Kae pushed some commits to the master branch, thanks for catching this. I 
have force pushed to clean up the commits.

Also, what is the url of the uefi upstream?
[TH] https://github.com/tianocore/edk2

Normally we don’t add our commits to the master branch of a project that has an upstream.  It looks like 
the uefi-socfpga master branch also has our stuff on it, judging by the email addresses in the commit 
log.  This makes me hesitant to overwrite the master branch.  
[TH] Yup I agree, my mistake for not catching the commits puhsed by SK.

I have determined that we don’t have any Intel or Altera release tags on github that are pointing to the 
master branch so that is good; all our tags point to our named release branches.

If we’re going to update the master branch, it seems like the thing to do would be to update the master 
branch to the current clean upstream and keep it clean from here onwards and continue to release our 
stuff on our named release branches as we have been doing.  Or am I misunderstanding something 
here?
[TH] Yup you’re right, I’ve made a force push to revert all SK’s changes, and rebased to uefi upstream’s 
latest commit.

Hey Alan,

I’m not sure if the community normally rebase the master branch, but for this one time, can you help 
make the rebased push?

Also, arm-trusted-firmware needs the master branch to be updated too. A summary so that we are on 
the same page: 
1.	arm-trusted-firmware -  master, socfpga_v1.4
2.	uefi-socfpga – master (rebased), socvp_socfpga_udk2015

Thanks
Tien Hock

Subject: RE: Bi-weekly sync between github and at-git for arm-trusted-firmware and uefi-socfpga

I ran in into a problem with the uefi-socfpga master branch.  I was not able to update the master branch 
on the portal because at-git’s master branch has been rebased since the last time it was pushed to the 
portal.

I went ahead with the rest of the portal update including: 
repo: arm-trusted-firmware  branch: socfpga_v1.4
repo: uefi-socfpga  branch: socvp_socfpga_udk2015

Does the upstream uefi project normally rebase the master branch?

Hi Tien Hock,

Yes, no problem.

Now we’ll update both master and socvp_socfpga_udk2015 for uefi-socfpga.

Next update will be Thursday April 4.

Hey Alan,

Can you help set up uefi-socfpga branch socvp_socfpga_udk2015 as well? 
Sorry I think I didn’t specify uefi-socfpga branch previously.

Thanks

OK I got it set up.   We will be releasing:

repo: arm-trusted-firmware  
branch: socfpga_v1.4


repo: uefi-socfpga
branch: master
Note that for uefi-socfpga, github has 3 other branches in addition to master but we will currently only 
be updating master.

Alan,

Yup, every other week, same as uboot-socfpga and linux-socfpga. For now, it should be the master 
branch, and socfpga_v1.4. 

Thanks

Hi Tien Hock,

Yes, no problem.  So these will be updated to github every other week like uboot-socfpga and linux-
socfpga.  Which branches will be currently releasing?

Alan

Alan,

Can you help setup a bi-weekly sync between github and at-git for arm-trusted-firmware and uefi-
socfpga, like in uboot-socfpga and linux-socfpga?

Thanks
Tien Hock
